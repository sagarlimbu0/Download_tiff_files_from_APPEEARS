## ECOSTRESS LST(Land Surface Temperature)
#### Steps to retrieve ECOSTRESS; LST in a tiff format and visualization using QGIS

This tutorial will provide the required steps to extract <b>ECOSTRESS</b>; LST product from the <b>AppEEARS</b> website. This tutorial is <b>not</b> officially funded or part of any training. 

#### Objective:

We can use python for data processing to locate <b>LST</b> product from ECOSTRESS dataset, but there can be limitation on applying right scale of color range of the product (LST). For usability purpose for all users, following steps can help users generate tiff format of ECOSTRESS; LST and other products. Further, tiff format files can be used for visualization using different softwares like QGIS, etc. 

### STEPS:
- For more information on ECOSTRESS mission and to learn more about the mission's objectives you can visist:

#### Data retrieval process can be performed by following sections:
- [DATA](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/data)
- NOTE: Extracting tiff format files are performed using the AppEEARS website. First, users need to create account on [EarthData Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=ecostress&ac=true) website and login to [AppEEARS](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/)
